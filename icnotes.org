** We are always working when watching a film

Any film relies on us to supply information.
We read a film without even thinking about it.

** Mise-en-scene

Mise-en-scène is very much about the relationship between the film and the audience.
Mise-en-scène is something we hold onto (such as costume).
A lot of what we remember and know about a film is because of mise-en-scène.
Audience knowledge, audience understanding, collective inventory.
Mise-en-scène depends on audience to be able to do that work.

Definitions.

1. It's a term meaning staging production.
2. French phrase used to described the staging of a play.
3. Putting on action or seen on stage (everything that is visible on screen).
4. The scenic elements of a film.
5. Arranging the scene.
6. A form of framing.
7. The expressiveness of film.
8. Director's control of what appears on film.
9. Staging of an event
10. (Favorite) How the visual elements (everything on the screen) are composed on each shot.

You can't assume that things are "just there".
Anything you see on the screen you can't assume is just there.
It's very subtle (visual orchestration).
Every object on screen is working with another object on screen.

Very careful planning.
Very careful construction.

Planning---placement of people, camera angles, lighting, etc.
Director has a reason for this.
Each thing that is put into a shot or a scene---it's put there for a reason.

It's about creating an effect.
Everything tells a story.
"What contribution does it make?"

** Four main components of mise-en-scène.

Setting.
"The container of events."

Human figure.
Body placement.
Props.
Makeup.
Acting.
Expression.
"What does the human figure do?"
"What does the human figure look like?"
The physicality of the human figure
Body placement of human figure --- what does it contribute to the overall story?
The makeup of an actor is contributing to the story

Lighting.
How do your eyes tell a story.

Space composition.
"Organization of everything on the screen and how it helps develop the narrative."

Todays Topic: Cinematography & Lighting

** Notes on Cinematography

- Any shot implies significance
- "What meaning is conveyed by the type of shot?"
- Any shot will shape unfolding drama
- Illicit an emotional response
- A good way to adjust to cinematography is to "go with your gut"---what's your immediate emotional response... to this extreme close up, to this long shot

** Screening 1

*** Mise-en-Scène

- It's summer time: it's sunny, the girl is eating a popsicle
- It's in the suburbs: trees, sparse cars
- Composition: The road sides/sidewalks creates lines down the screen
- Cars look like from 70s-80s

*** Cinematography

- Faded memories; something in the past
- Think about it: "How would you fade your memories?"

** Screening 2 (James Bond)

- Whenever Bond is in the shadows it feels very suspenseful

- When he's out of the shadows and he goes outside he disappears, implying a spy character

- Whenever he's in focus, it's a close-up shot.
  Otherwise, it's a long shot.

- Long shot--silhouette;
  Medium shot--lit up;

** Screening 3

- Beginning of film

  + Runners running down road

- Next clip of film

  + Man on the run

* 2022-09-13

** Editing

- Taking individual shots and putting them together
- Selection and arrangement
- Basic creative force of filmmaking
- Controls the creative expressive power of the film
- Key verbs:
  + Selecting
  + Arranging
  + Assembling
- The joining together of two shots
- Key term: cutting or splicing
- Editing is about feeling a rhythm
- Material cut or break in the film
- Contributes to a film's organization and its effect on its spectators
- 3 key points:
  1) Draw your attention to the change in the mise-en-scène
  2) Encourages audiences to compare and contrast the cinematography in each shot
     - Example: The Virgin Suicides going from green to blue
  3) Gives us abrupt changes; these abrupt changes create an emotional response
- Action films contain 3000 or more shots
- Editing shapes viewers experiences, even if they aren't aware of it

** Screening #1 (Gravity)

- First shot
  + Super long duration: shows us vastness of the planet

** Screening #2 (La La Land)

** Screening #6 (The Shining)

* 2022-09-15

** Editing Overview

- Taking individual shots and joining them together.

- Selecting and arranging shots to make it flow and create a unique narrative.

- The editor has the responsibility of manipulating (handling, cutting, and assembling) the footage.
  Think in terms of narrative form, continuity/discontinuity, and augmentation of the film's collective vision.

** Continuity (See 180° Rule)

- Example: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak70AEHw1as][Slumdog Millionaire "Are you nervous?" clip]]

  + Character positions remain consistent in between cuts (contestant to the left and host to the right)

  + Shot/reverse shot [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1Ey0a6LJRA][(see shot/reverse shot in The Hunger Games)]]

  + Editing comes across as natural and doesn't call attention to itself

** Discontinuity

- Example: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkSTpL18XV8][The Dark Knight: When to break the 180° rule]]

  + Shot/reverse shot

  + Positions of Batman and The Joker change between the cuts (the camera "jumped the line")

  + Editing creates a sense of confusion, instability, and tension

** 180° Rule

- The camera should remain on one side of the imaginary axis so there is continuity in character placement

- Moving over the axis is called "jumping the line" and although it breaks the rule, it has its purpose in place in film

** 1st shot + 2nd shot = 3rd meaning

- Example: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gGl3LJ7vHc][Kuleshov Effect]]

  + Based on two shots in a sequence we are able to make assumptions or draw conclusions

  + Watch the facial expressions in the clip and see how your view changes between shots.
    What connections can you infer between the soup (or doll or woman) and the reaction shot?

** Editing Review

- Example One: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az-VjJLwn2I][The Big Chill]] opening

  + There are extreme close-ups of a body being dressed interspersed between character introductions (consider the mise en scene and cinematography)

  + The editing pulls together a disparate group of people/individuals using the common thread of the body

  + The scene begins with a family unit and slowly moves away until we are left with an individual consuming pills, smoking a joint, and driving irresponsibly

  + When it's revealed that the body is a corpse being dressed, it invites further analysis of the relationship between these five people

- Example Two: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHW2gU8eoS4][Silence of the Lambs]]

  + The arrangement and cutting manipulate the third meaning formula by allowing the viewer to naturally assume the scenes are connected, though they are not

- Example Three: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDFdroN7d0w][Marriage Story]]

  + Dissolution of a marriage told through editing and shot composition

  + Both characters are filmed individually

** Class Notes: Editing

- The editor is responsible for manipulating footage (cutting, assembling)

- Create continuity out of discontinuity

- Choreographing a scene

- Continuity: continuous editing, seamless, everyone remains in the same place

  + The camera does not cross the line (match on action)

  + Editing that doesn't cause attention to itself

  + Example: shot - reverse shot - shot - reverse shot

- Discontinuity: discontinuous editing, breaks the 180 rule by crossing the line, a disruption

  + Can be slow and not clear

  + Evokes sometime, often a fleeting moment (confusion, craziness, disorientation, etc.)

- Adding the first two shots and forming a meaning

  + Doesn't need to be a connection between 1 and 2, the audience does that

  + We attach a third meanin to two shots that have no meaning connection

- What do you know, how do you know it, how does editing tell you?

- Creates the thread that pulls everything together

- You read the shots

- How does the plot summary work with the editing?

- Use the language! (cut, arrange, splice)

- "Naturally assume"

- How are you being manipulated?

- How do you reinforce what's going on in the story by using editing?

* 2022-09-20

- Central question: "To what effect?"

- Sound guides our attention

- Sound helps define space

- Sound conveys mood and characters state of mind

- Sound arouses expectations

- Sound in film studies always should be considered in its relationship to image

- Sound is integral to the cinematic story

- Sound is created specifically for the story

- Sound is working on a physical and psychological level

- Diegetic: in film world

- Non-diegetic: outside film world

- If the character can hear the sound then it's diegetic, otherwise it's non-diegetic

- Silence of the Lamb sounds: swallow; birds; footsteps

* 2022-09-22

** Key Terms

- Synchronous: On screen sound coming from real source

- Asynchronous: Off screen sound (not precisely matched)

** Review

- Complete 180° (The Shining): provides meaning not provided by mise-en-scene or cinematography

- Creates visceral emotion (Zero Dark Thirty)

- Diegetic/Non-diegetic

- Distinguishing from diegetic/non-diegetic:

  + "Can the character hear it?"

** Screening 1 (Moonlight) (asynchronous sound)

*** Clip 1 (Woman talking to boy)

https://youtu.be/9aFObKJR7YA

- Makes it feel like a hallucination, something's kind of off

  + The editing and sound reinforce that

- Think diegetic/non-diegetic

- Think synchronous/asynchronous

** Screening 2 (Carrie) (1976) (prom scene) (silence as sound)

https://youtu.be/XTMue4Dyvr4

- Mise-en-scene:

  + Girl in pristine white dress, the music matches with angelic harp

- Cinematography:

  + Close-up on girl underneath staircase, the music abruptly changes to a darker sound, completely changing the mood

- Silence:

  + Tuning everything out except her thoughts

  + Swirling vignettes give isolating feeling, sounds: repeated asynchronous lines

    - It's about to break at some point

- Sounds:

  + Psycho sound: asynchronous/non-diegetic

  + Voices in head: asynchronous/non-diegetic

  + Laughter

  + Clapping

  + Door slamming

  + Loud gusty wind sound -- "storm is coming"

  + Loud hum: asynchronous/non-diegetic

** Screening 3 (Amour) (stroke scene) (silence as sound)

https://youtu.be/KIb2j1QW3z4

- This is a very sad, sad scene

- Think about how silence is functioning here

* 2022-09-29

** Shot-by-shot analysis

- Avoid using your favorite film

- You should watch your clip to the point that you're sick of it

- Chart everything out---to be submitted with the analysis

- Take a step back:

  - You need a thesis for this

    - It can't just be "this clip makes good use of editing"

    - Better thesis: "This clip immerses the audience in a war-like chaotic theater"

- You don't want a five paragraph theme for this essay

- A really good analysis starts with the easiest thing and ends with the most complicated part

  - E.g., I want to start with editing become it's overwhelming in this clip; and want to end with something that is apparent to me but might not be obvious to others (such as cinematography)

- It's all about logical order

  - It's like sitting next to a stranger and explaining to them your analysis

** Narrative review

- Narrative is the story from a certain point of view

  + Story is like the framework of the plots

    - Plots are like the chapters of the storybook

** Exercise (The Sweet Hereafter)

- Plot out the scenes

- Note when you were confused/lost

- What is anchoring your understanding

- Watch the timer

  - "I'm 3 minutes in and I'm lost"

  - "I'm 6 minutes in and I'm still lost"

  + To tell us a certain truth

  + We generally watch documentary films to learn something new

  + In terms of purpose

  + Mode of production

** Ideology

*** What is Ideology?

- Ideas

- Values

- Attitudes

- Beliefs

- Perception (way of looking at the world)

- Way of thinking

- System of beliefs that groups of people share and _believe are inherently true and acceptable_

- _Most ideological beliefs are rarely questioned by those who hold them_

- _These beliefs are naturalized because of their constant and unquestioned usage_

- They are "self evident"

- No one needs to explain these ideas, because supposedly everyone knows them

*** Dominant Ideologies

- When an ideology is functioning optimally within a society, individuals are incapable recognizing that these ideas are socially constructed opinions and not objective truths

- These ideologies are _dominant_ because they tend to structure in pervasive ways how a culture thinks about itself and others, who and what it upholds as _worthy_, _meaningful_, _true_, and _valuable_.

*** White, Patriarchal, Capitalism

- United States founded on and still adheres to dominant ideology of W,P,C

- This ideology permeates the way most Americans think about themselves and the world around them.
  (This ideology also permeates most American film.)

- _White_: refers to ideology that people of Western and Northern descent are somehow better than are people whose ancestry is traced to other parts of the world

- _Patriarchal_: refers to a culture predicated on the belief that men are the most members of society

- And thus entitled to greater opportunity and access to power

- As part of American patriarchy, heterosexuality is condoned within a heterosexual marriage, reinforces women's role as child-bearing and child-raising property of men

- _Capitalism_: belief that success and worth are measured by one's material wealth

- Think of the vision of the "American dream"

- Almost always invokes financial success: a big house, big car, vacations, etc.

- Ideology of W,P,C works not only to naturalize previous ideas, but to protect them

- Never stable or rigid, always in flux

- Hegemony: ongoing struggle to maintain consent of the people to a system that governs them.
  (Hebdidge essay)

- Social control won over and over again

- Example: women's right to vote

*** Althusser

- How social systems enforce control

- Subtly molding human subjects through ideology

- Ideology makes US "subjects" of the dominant social order

- Ideology is not voluntary but the result of structural factors in society

*** ISA and RSA

- ISA: Ideological state apparatuses

- Societal mechanisms for creating obedient citizens who practice dominant values

- Civil institutions that have legal standing

  + Church

  + School

  + Courts

  + Political parties

- RSA: Repressive state apparatuses

- (maintain power through implicit consent -- not force)

  + police

  + military

  + prison system

  + government

  + law

*** Film and Ideology

- Movies have an ideological function

- Persuade the audience that a particular view or way of life is desirable

- Every film = value as a (ideological) document

- Document that reflects and influences a society's ideology

- Hollywood supports underlying ideologies by relying on stereotypes (think mise-en-scene, genre)

- Hollywood film industryr suppresses certain stories of certain individuals or groups

*** Films are barometers of culture

Films shape our ideas about:

- Sexuality
- Race
- Class
- Capitalism
- Technology
- Gender
- Poor/wealthy
- The good life
- The "right" life

*** What messages does your film carry?

- About "the way things should be"?
- What does it "teach" you?
- What does the film legitimize? Promote?
- What does it support?
- What view of the world is being expressed?

*** Media Clips used in class
