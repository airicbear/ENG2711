* Quiz (Assassination of Jesse James)

** Question 1

The clouds rushing in become extremely dark, dominating and overwhelming in this shot, transforming a beautiful sunset into a place of unknown which gives the film an ominous feeling.
The only light we can see comes from far away in the distance which implies that hope and peace is fading away from us.

** Question 2

The dark clouds which overwhelm what should be a beautiful warm sunset is an extremely long shot.
This type of shot emphasizes the dominance of the clouds in the film, which implies that the main character's life is overwhelmed, giving a sense of helplessness about the main character.

** Question 3

In the two shots after the overwhelming dark clouds, we see the main character in a close-up shot and then a long shot of his silhouette against a fire going across the entire screen.
In the close-up shot of the main character, we get a very dark background where only his face and neck are lit up as he stares into the light with a scared expression.
The camera moves in closer to his face which gives a foreboding sense of danger.
The long shot of his silhouette against the fire indicates that the fire will overwhelm his life until he burns up into flames.

** Question 4

In this clip, we see a clear pattern of the film getting darker with each shot.
In the beginning, we get shots of the outside clouds where they are bright white and in the shots inside the house, everything is well lit giving a sense of peace and happiness.
We then get shots of when the main character goes out into town in his black suit and hat where the shots become dimmer to the point that the faces of other characters are not even visible making the other people insignificant.
When the main character goes out into the wheatfields, the sky progressively gets darker until the scene becomes pitch black until nothing exists except the character and the fire.
This progression of darkness in the clip conveys a sense of death.
When I think of death, I think of the world becoming darker and darker, and this is exactly what the lightning in the clip is doing.
